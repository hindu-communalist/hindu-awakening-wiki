“there had always been a question mark hanging over Mary’s sexual
morality” and that “it was clearly a subject which caused the early Christians
acute embarrassment”.`,

    comments: `The statement is -: “Now if Christ
is preached,” he wrote to the Corinthians in 49 AD, “asraised from the
dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been
raised; if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain
and your faith is in vain. We are even found to be misrepresenting
God, because we testified of God that he raised Christ, whom he did not
raise if it is true that the dead are not raised.”`,

16.9-20 referring to Jesus’ appearance after death and the world
mission of Christianity, have been added at a later stage. The original
gospel comes to an end at 16.8 in the ancient manuscripts.`,

Clement of Alexandria who lived at the end of the first century AD
and a contemporary character, Theodore. It concerned a passage that
followed immediately after Mark 10.46 which makes Jesus arrive at and
leave Jericho. Scholars were puzzled for centuries as to what happened
at that place, but there was no clue. The correspondence between
Clement and Theodore contains the passage which had been censored out
of Mark for fear of raising a scandal. The passage says that Jesus
spent several days and nights withLazarus, both of them remaining naked.`,

    quote: `The New English Bible version of the New Testament published
jointly by Oxford and Cambridge universities in 1961 mentions many
instances where passages have been inserted or taken out. The most
significant example is that of John 8.11 which tells the story of how
Jesus saved from being stoned a woman caught in adultery. “This
passage, which in the most widely received editions of the New
Testament is printed in the text of John 7.53-8.11, has no fixed place
in our ancient manuscripts. Some of them do not contain it at all.
Some place it after Luke 21.38, others after John 7.36 or 7.52, or
21.24.”40 In any case, the story does not occur in any manuscript
prior to the end of the fourth century. Scholars are now agreed that it
is an interpolation.`,

made to cry from the cross, “Father, forgive them; they do not know what they are doing.” Incidentally, these are precisely the two statements,

Jesus quote most frequently`,

has created a ludicrous scene — that of Jesus riding into Jerusalem not on
one but on two asses simultaneously! It seems that the gospel writers did
not understand the deviceof parallelismso often employed inHebrewpoetry. Zechariah never meant that the Messiah would ride on two asses at the
same time.`,

the original authors never intended any, and adapt or even alter the
